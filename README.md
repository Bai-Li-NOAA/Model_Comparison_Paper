# Stock-Assessment-Model-Comparison-Project

This repository contains an age-strcutured operating model (OM) and its outputs. The OM is used to generate input data for estimation models (e.g. AMAK, ASAP, BAM, and SS). It allows comparison of the estimation model output with true dynamics simulated in the OM.
